## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The use of `width: max(100% - x, y)` to set a containers' minimum width of `y` but that are allowed to grow up to `100% - x`.

### Useful resources

- [MDN's `max()` definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max).
