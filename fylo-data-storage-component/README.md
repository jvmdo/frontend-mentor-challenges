## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first approach
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- `background-size: cover` requires HTML element to be `100vh` in order to fill up the whole page view height;

- Sometimes it is possible to use `Flexbox` in such a way that the component is responsive without using `media queries`.

- `clip-path: polygon()` for creation of many shapes.

- I could not apply styles to the `<meter>` element.
