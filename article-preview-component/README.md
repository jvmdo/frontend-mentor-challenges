## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Grid

### What I learned

- I was struggling trying to figure out why the image container's width did not match the image width. Its quite obvious but the theory escaped from my mind. There is a StackOverflow answer about it linked below.

- In order to make `object-fit` work, it is necessary either the image naturally be bigger then its container or set explicitly the image size using `width` and/or `height`. Note: `min-width: 100%` is not explicit.

- `object-position` is used to position a fitted image within its container.

- `grid-auto-flow: column` can be very helpful.

- I did a pseudo-element `transition` üòéüòÅ
