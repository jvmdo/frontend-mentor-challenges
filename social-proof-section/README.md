## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 only
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Flexbox is very useful even when the layout seems to need a grid. Applying `flex-wrap: wrap` can sometimes be the answer.

- It's ALWAYS important review the two layouts before getting into code. I had not realize the stars inside the rating list can't be `list-style-type` until I get into mobile layout.

### Useful resources

- [MDN's reference for styling lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists).
