## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Grid

### What I learned

- How to use the HTML `details` and `summary` elements.

- Deal with "shadows of images" is annoying.

- Maybe I could get the same result without using to much positioning and translate things if I centered the images withing their cell (in grind).
